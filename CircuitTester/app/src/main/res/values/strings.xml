    <string name = "not_gate_description" > The NOT gate is a component that reverses its input.
    It is also known as an inverter, if the input value is 1 the output will be 0. </string>
    <string name = "and_gate_description" > AND gates have two inputs (bits) and one output.
    The output of this kind of gate will be 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise it will be 0. </string>
    <string name = "or_gate_description" > The OR gate has two inputs, if one of its input is 1
    the output will be 1. The only way that it would produce a low output would be if
    both inputs are 0. </string>
    <string name = "xor_gate_description" > The XOR gate will produce a high output
    if either (but not both) of its inputs are 1. </string>

    <string name = "voltage_description" > This component produces a 1 output. </string>

    input is 1. </string>
